# LL-Parser
A 1600+ line long piece of Code written in C programming language which works as an LL Parser. An LL Parser is a parser that is used in Compiler Design. This programs checks whether the grammar is a Context Free Grammar or not. If yes then it removes Ambiguity, Left Recursion from the grammar if they are present. Then it checks that whether the grammar is left factored. If not then it left factors the grammar. Then it creates a LL table for the grammar. Then it checks whether the grammar is LL1 or not. If the grammar is LL(1) then the user can check if the grammar can produce a certain string. The program runs as long as the user doesn't terminate it.
